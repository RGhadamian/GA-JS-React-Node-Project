# Project 3 
## React JS CRUD App with Express backend & Mongo -- MERN

### Technical Requirements
Backend: connects provides a API for React front end by performing CRUD operations on MongoDB using Mongoose package Frontend: Uses routes to display various React components, provides CRUD functions through forms and querying backend API.

#### Express
- API Crud endpoints interacting with minimum 1 model
- Endpoints use expected HTTP methods
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

*Mongoose & MongoDB*
- minimum 1 mongoose model

#### React
- One parent component controlling one or more child components
- Provides CRUD operations through forms
- CRUD operations query backend (which in turn updates the database) for persistence
- Makes use of routes where appropriate

For example the blog app we have been working on in class meets this requirements, example project here: TBC
